# AI Image Replacer

## Purpose

### AI Image Replacer is an extension for Google Chrome that allows users to either eliminate AI-generated images or replace them with warning text. Because these images can often appear very realistic, people may assume in some instances that they were created by a real person. For artists in particular, this possibility is especially troubling as it means that the work they put considerable effort and emotion into may go unnoticed while a generated one gets praised. We hope to protect the hard work of artists across the globe by informing users when an image is identified as AI-generated and providing them with the option to eliminate the image altogether.
